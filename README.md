# Description
As a developer, we use git everyday for tracking our code. But have you ever thought about how git is working (tracking updates, commit updates....)? But when I clone the git resource code which is written in C and try to read it, I just feel a little bit difficult to understand.

This is why I created this repository, just to learn how git is working and try to using Golang to write one.
